# Containerds
Python, because we cannot remember Java


- opened IDE 
- made a folder, then file
- explicitly said it was a .py
- install python
- install pip
- installed bottle
- write code
- compiled code > byte code > interpreter > machine code
- validated functionality on browser


OUR STEPS
-clone the repo 
-check if you have python installed
-brew install python 3
-brew install pip 3
-pip3 install bottle
-run containerds.py
-go to localhot on port 8080
